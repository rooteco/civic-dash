It’s difficult to segment the theme into specific problems because of how interconnected all of the root causes are, so for Abundant Housing indicators tend to be segmented based on the aspect of the overarching theme that they most relate to.</p><p>We’re working on integrating the stories of some of these people into the dashboard. For now, you can read about some of them in an excellent article by Vox on the subject <a target='_blank' href='https://www.vox.com/a/homeless-san-francisco-tech-boom'>[5]</a>.</p>",
